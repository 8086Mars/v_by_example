# Contributing

## General

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* New example or improvements to existing examples are welcome.
* Please check your spelling and grammar.

## A Note on Example Versions
All examples should include the following header:

```markdown
---
version: 3.5.1
example_title: JSON
---
```

Change the `version` attribute according to the following rules:

* MAJOR — You (re)wrote the whole thing. Your new content will need some translation.
* MINOR — Added or removed some content, few sentences, etc.
* PATCH — Spelling, typos. Probably not translated stuff.

We follow [SemVer.org](https://semver.org) pattern. This is important because we use that to determine and inform translators of new content that requires translation.

## Adding a New Example

To add a new example, create a new folder and a file or a file (depending upon the example) under the appropriate directory in `./examples`. Please check the `.plan` file to see what examples we plan to create. Feel free to work on any pending examples. We're happy to read/review your changes and collaborate/code with you to merge them.

Thank you for your contributions!
