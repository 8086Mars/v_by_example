## Keywords

V is a very small language so it has few keywords. There are around 25 keywords.

| Keywords | in     | V   | Programming | Language  |
| -------- | ------ | --- | ----------- | --------- |
| else     | enum   | fn  | for         | struct    |
| go       | goto   | if  | else        |           |
| type     | pub    | fn  | in          | interface |
| match    | module | mut | none        | or        |

Like other languages, they cannot be used as a variable.
